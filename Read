Hi all ..this is a game where u can have two players.
first who starts the game will be 'O'
the other will be 'X'
while playing in the matrix of 3*3 ,if there are three consecutive symbols either horizontally or vertically or diagonally the game stops and declare winner


now the main file is program.cs
where main function is present
it calls Main.cs
from Main.cs it goes to Form1.cs
here the code for the game is present


that's all ..thank you ..you can modify this game..i will be very happy if u come up with good ideas
